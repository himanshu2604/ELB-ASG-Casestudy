## 🚀 ROI & Financial Metrics

### Return on Investment
```
5-Year ROI = (Total Savings - Migration Cost) / Migration Cost × 100
5-Year ROI = ($58,550 - $2,400) / $2,400 × 100 = 2,339%
```

### Net Present Value (NPV)
```
NPV = Σ(Savings per Year / (1 + Discount Rate)^n) - Initial Investment
NPV = $48,420 (highly positive, project approved)
```

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
**IRR = 145%** (far exceeds corporate hurdle rate of 15%)
