## ðŸ“ˆ Predictive Scaling Cost Model

### Machine Learning-Based Predictions
```python
# Cost prediction model parameters
base_cost = 225  # 2-instance minimum
variable_cost_per_instance = 42
fixed_monthly_costs = 141  # ALB, NAT, Route53, etc.

def predict_monthly_cost(avg_instances, peak_multiplier=1.3):
    base_instance_cost = avg_instances * variable_cost_per_instance
    peak_adjustment = (peak_multiplier - 1) * 0.2 * base_instance_cost
    return fixed_monthly_costs + base_instance_cost + peak_adjustment
```
