## ðŸ“ˆ ROI Calculations

### Year 1 ROI Analysis
```
Initial Investment: $3,050
Annual Savings: $11,124
Annual Investment: $1,100
Net Annual Benefit: $10,024

Year 1 ROI = (Net Annual Benefit - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment Ã— 100
Year 1 ROI = ($10,024 - $3,050) / $3,050 Ã— 100 = 228%
```

### Cumulative ROI Analysis

#### 3-Year Financial Projection
| Year | Initial Investment | Annual Investment | Annual Savings | Net Benefit | Cumulative ROI |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Year 0** | $3,050 | $0 | $0 | -$3,050 | -100% |
| **Year 1** | $0 | $1,100 | $11,124 | $10,024 | 228% |
| **Year 2** | $0 | $1,100 | $11,678 | $10,578 | 575% |
| **Year 3** | $0 | $1,100 | $12,262 | $11,162 | 964% |

*Note: Savings increase 5% annually due to on-premise cost inflation*

### Advanced Financial Metrics

#### Net Present Value (NPV) Calculation
**Assumptions**:
- Discount rate: 8% (corporate cost of capital)
- Project timeline: 3 years
- Inflation rate: 5% for on-premise costs

| Year | Cash Flow | Present Value Factor | Present Value |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 0 | -$3,050 | 1.000 | -$3,050 |
| 1 | $10,024 | 0.926 | $9,282 |
| 2 | $10,578 | 0.857 | $9,065 |
| 3 | $11,162 | 0.794 | $8,863 |

**NPV = $24,160** (Highly positive, project is financially viable)

#### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Using financial calculations:
**IRR = 285%** (Significantly exceeds required return rate)

#### Payback Period
```
Cumulative Cash Flow Analysis:
Month 0: -$3,050
Month 1: -$3,050 + $837 = -$2,213
Month 2: -$2,213 + $837 = -$1,376
Month 3: -$1,376 + $837 = -$539
Month 4: -$539 + $837 = $298

Payback Period: 3.6 months
```
