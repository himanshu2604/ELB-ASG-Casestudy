## 🎯 Auto Scaling Best Practices

### **Scaling Policy Configuration**
```bash
# Recommended scaling thresholds
Scale-Out: CPU > 70% (not 80%) for faster response
Scale-In: CPU < 40% (not 60%) for better cost optimization
Evaluation Periods: 2 consecutive periods (10 minutes)
Cooldown: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
```

**✅ Best Practices:**
- **Target Tracking Policy**: Use target tracking over step scaling for consistent performance
- **Multiple Metrics**: Consider memory, network, and custom application metrics alongside CPU
- **Gradual Scaling**: Scale out by 2 instances, scale in by 1 for stability
- **Capacity Limits**: Set realistic min (2), max (15), and desired (3) capacity based on actual usage patterns

**❌ Common Mistakes:**
- Setting aggressive thresholds (90% CPU) causing poor user experience
- Using only CPU metrics without considering application-specific metrics
- Insufficient cooldown periods causing rapid scaling oscillations
- Not accounting for instance launch time in scaling decisions

## 🎯 Load Balancer Optimization

### **Application Load Balancer Configuration**
```yaml
Health Check Settings:
  Path: "/health" or "/status" (not just "/")
  Interval: 30 seconds
  Timeout: 5 seconds
  Healthy Threshold: 2
  Unhealthy Threshold: 3
  Matcher: 200,301,302
```

**✅ Best Practices:**
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Create dedicated health check endpoint for better monitoring
- **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**: Enable for even distribution across AZs
- **Connection Draining**: Set 300-second deregistration delay for graceful shutdown
- **Sticky Sessions**: Avoid if possible; use external session store (Redis/DynamoDB)

**🔧 Advanced Configurations:**
- **Request Routing**: Use path-based routing for microservices
- **SSL Termination**: Terminate SSL/TLS at load balancer level
- **Access Logs**: Enable for troubleshooting and analytics
- **WAF Integration**: Add Web Application Firewall for security

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### **Network Security Architecture**
```
Internet Gateway
    ↓
Public Subnets (ALB only)
    ↓
Private Subnets (EC2 instances)
    ↓
NAT Gateways (outbound only)
```

**✅ Security Layers:**
1. **VPC Isolation**: Use dedicated VPC with proper CIDR planning
2. **Subnet Segmentation**: Public subnets for ALB, private for EC2
3. **Security Groups**: Principle of least privilege
4. **NACLs**: Additional layer for subnet-level filtering
5. **IAM Roles**: Instance profiles with minimal required permissions

**🔒 Security Group Rules:**
```bash
# Web Server Security Group
Inbound:
  - HTTP (80): Source = ALB Security Group
  - HTTPS (443): Source = ALB Security Group
  - SSH (22): Source = Bastion Host or specific IP ranges
  - Custom metrics (varies): Source = Monitoring systems

Outbound:
  - HTTP (80): Destination = 0.0.0.0/0 (for updates)
  - HTTPS (443): Destination = 0.0.0.0/0 (for updates)
  - NTP (123): Destination = 0.0.0.0/0 (time sync)
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### **CloudWatch Metrics Strategy**
**✅ Essential Metrics:**
- **EC2**: CPUUtilization, NetworkIn/Out, StatusCheck
- **ASG**: GroupDesiredCapacity, GroupInServiceInstances
- **ALB**: RequestCount, TargetResponseTime, HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count
- **Custom**: Application-specific metrics (queue depth, active users)

**📈 Dashboard Setup:**
```bash
# Create comprehensive dashboard
aws cloudwatch put-dashboard --dashboard-name "XYZ-Corp-Infrastructure" --dashboard-body file://dashboard-config.json
```

**⚠️ Alert Configuration:**
- **High Priority**: Instance failures, ALB unhealthy targets
- **Medium Priority**: High CPU (>85%), scaling events
- **Low Priority**: Cost anomalies, performance degradation
- **SNS Integration**: Multi-channel notifications (email, Slack, SMS)

---

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategies

### **Right-Sizing and Cost Control**
**✅ Immediate Optimizations:**
- **Instance Types**: Use t3.medium for web servers, consider t4g for ARM workloads
- **Reserved Instances**: Purchase RIs for baseline capacity (30-60% savings)
- **Spot Instances**: Use for development/testing environments
- **Scheduled Scaling**: Implement predictive scaling for known traffic patterns

**📊 Cost Monitoring:**
```bash
# Set up cost alerts
aws budgets create-budget --account-id [ACCOUNT_ID] --budget file://monthly-budget.json
aws budgets create-subscriber --account-id [ACCOUNT_ID] --budget-name "XYZ-Corp-Monthly" --notification file://cost-alert.json --subscriber file://subscriber.json
```

**💡 Advanced Cost Strategies:**
- **Instance Families**: Mix different instance types in ASG for cost optimization
- **Data Transfer**: Use CloudFront CDN to reduce data transfer costs
- **Storage**: Implement lifecycle policies for EBS snapshots
- **Unused Resources**: Regular audits for orphaned resources

---

## 🔄 Deployment Best Practices

### **Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**
```bash
# Deployment process
1. Create new launch template version
2. Update ASG with new template
3. Gradually replace instances (10% at a time)
4. Monitor health and performance
5. Rollback if issues detected
```

**✅ Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Test launch template in development environment
- [ ] Backup current configuration
- [ ] Monitor scaling activities during deployment
- [ ] Verify health checks pass for new instances
- [ ] Check application logs for errors
- [ ] Validate performance metrics

**🚀 Infrastructure as Code:**
```yaml
# Use CloudFormation or Terraform
Resources:
  LaunchTemplate:
    Type: AWS::EC2::LaunchTemplate
    Properties:
      LaunchTemplateName: XYZ-Corp-LaunchTemplate-v2
      VersionDescription: Updated with security patches
```

## 🌐 DNS and Domain Management

### **Route 53 Configuration**
**✅ Best Practices:**
- **Health Checks**: Configure health checks for ALB endpoints
- **Alias Records**: Use alias records (not CNAME) for root domain
- **TTL Settings**: Use 300 seconds for A records, 3600 for NS records
- **Failover Routing**: Implement DNS failover for disaster recovery

**🔧 DNS Security:**
```bash
# Enable DNS logging
aws route53 create-query-logging-config --hosted-zone-id [ZONE_ID] --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn [LOG_GROUP_ARN]
```
